# Changelog

All notable changes to `shader-panel` are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-08

First stable release. API surface is now considered stable; subsequent breaking changes will bump the major.

### Added (since 0.5.0)
- **`useShaderDev` hook** — one call owns the config state, registers the shader, and auto-injects the panel (Leva-style), so integration is a single line in the shader file with no `<ShaderDevRoot/>` and no separate config/fields files. Returns a `useState`-style `[config, setConfig]`; persists + rehydrates automatically. Pass `autoMount: false` to mount the root yourself. `ShaderDevRoot` is now a singleton, so the auto-injected panel and an explicit `<ShaderDevRoot/>` never double-render.
- **Six built-in AI prompts, written as senior-graphics-engineer briefs** (~2k chars each): improve quality, optimize GPU, reduce shimmer / temporal aliasing, find runtime bugs & leaks, expose missing parameters, switch to adapters. Each has a prioritized checklist with concrete GLSL patterns and thresholds — linear-space color math, Reinhard/ACES tone mapping, TPDF dithering, derivative-based edge AA, portable integer hashes, warp-divergence and `mediump` tradeoffs, tiler/mobile pitfalls, the Three.js disposal chain, GLSL NaN/Inf hazards, and `fwidth` prefiltering for temporal stability.
- **Zero-edit prompts** — prompts reference files by project context (no paths to fill in) and auto-name the active shader via a `{{shader}}` token resolved at copy/preview time. New `fillShaderDevPrompt(text, name)` helper, exported.
- Auto-height animations on the saved indicator, sections, prompt previews, and the paste textarea using the CSS Grid `0fr ↔ 1fr` trick + delayed opacity fade.

### Fixed (since 0.5.0)
- Floating prompt copy button is now fully opaque (stacked `--sd-bg` gradients) so prompt text no longer bleeds through behind the icon.
- Slider overscroll spring no longer clipped by the collapse wrapper (`clip-path: inset(0 -9999px)` clips vertically only).
- Paste JSON textarea auto-focuses + scrolls into view on open; font size reduced and de-bled (specificity fix).

### Notes
- `shader-panel` is the package name; the repository moved to `tjcages/shader-panel` on GitHub.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- **localStorage persistence** — `loadPersistedShaderDevValues(id, defaults)` hydrates a shader's config on mount; the panel auto-persists on every change. "Reset to defaults" clears the storage entry.
- **Saved indicator** — "● Edits saved locally" appears below the action buttons whenever current values differ from defaults.
- **Paste JSON action** — bottom-of-panel button reveals a textarea for pasting a config blob; on Apply, known keys merge into the current config with inline validation.
- **Production zero-weight stub** — dual-entry build emits `dist/index.prod.js` (~5.6 KB) that bundlers auto-resolve under the `production` condition. Panel UI, store, keyboard, styles, and persistence I/O become no-ops; `createWebGLAdapter` / `createR3FAdapter` / `hexToRgb01` / `patchShaderConfigDefaults` stay functional. Subpath `shader-panel/dev` forces the full panel in any environment.
- **Auto-height animations** — sections, prompt previews, the saved indicator, and the paste textarea use the CSS Grid `0fr → 1fr` trick with a 280 ms spring bezier; opacity fades in over the same window.

### Fixed
- Action button background was transparent until hovered — same `[data-shader-dev] button` specificity bug that hit the color hex earlier. Scoped `.sd-action-btn` to win cleanly.
- "Edits saved locally" indicator now sits below the three action buttons and is horizontally centered.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Quick actions / AI prompts rail** with five built-in templates (improve quality, expose missing parameters, optimize GPU, find bugs, switch to adapters). Each row expands inline to preview the prompt; floating copy icon writes to clipboard with brief feedback. Customize per-shader via `registerShaderDev({ prompts: [...] })`.
- **Per-section reset** — hover-revealed `↻` on each section header resets only that section's keys.

### Changed
- Section headers restyled as 10 px / 600 weight / 0.1 em letter-spacing uppercase category labels; chevron extracted into its own button so the reset can sit between title and caret.
- Prompt rows match slider row visuals (36 px surface row, no awkward bg darkening on hover).
- Keyboard shortcut hint disabled by default — pass `shortcutHint` to `ShaderDevPanel` to opt back in.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Multi-shader registry** — `registerShaderDev(reg)` now returns its own cleanup fn (idiomatic `useEffect` pattern). Internal `Map<id, registration>` plus an active-shader switcher in the panel header when 2+ shaders are mounted.
- **New field types** — `toggle` (boolean switch), `select` (typed dropdown), `vec2` (paired sliders for `[x, y]` tuples).
- **Adapter helpers** — `createWebGLAdapter` returns `(config) => uniforms` for raw WebGL / `ShaderMount`; `createR3FAdapter` returns `apply(config)` that mutates Three.js uniform `.value` slots in place. Both auto-handle hex → vec3 and `.set(...)` detection.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-08

### Changed
- **Replaced Tailwind v4 with a self-contained CSS module.** Single `<style>` injection on first mount; theming via `--sd-*` custom properties on `[data-shader-dev]`. No build setup required for consumers.
- **Replaced `motion` peer dep with CSS transitions.** Slider drag still uses direct DOM mutation via CSS variables; spring-like feel via `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.16, 0.64, 1)`.

### Added
- **tsup build pipeline** emitting ESM + `.d.ts`. Proper `exports` map, MIT license, repository / keywords / homepage metadata.

## [0.1.0] — Initial

- Single-shader registration store, floating panel with slider / color controls, keyboard shortcut, copy/write JSON. Tailwind-class-based styling, `motion` for spring animations.
